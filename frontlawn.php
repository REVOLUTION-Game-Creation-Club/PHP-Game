        <p>
        Outside Koupy is yelling to anyone that will listen. "How dare they destroy this competition! Who would ever do this! What a tragedy! Pie should be honored, it should be worshipped! How dare they!"
        <br> <br>
        Hoide is pumping their fist in agreement. You approach Hoide and ask: "What do you think happened in there?"
        <br> <br>
        "You know, I don't know. And I don't like you asking me questions as if I do know. I just like pie. I baked a pie and it was good. Gring really seemed to like my pie. I really thought I had a chance this year. But some screwball had to come ruin it for us all. I'm so angry! I could beat the thief up!"
         <br>  <br>  
        You look around for Gring but they are nowhere to be found. Instead you see Woliod on the far edge of the lawn, grimacing and pacing.
        <br> <br>
        You approach Woliod: "Everything okay over here?"
        <br> <br>
        "Oh yeah things are fine. Things are just great. Wow. You know how to read a book. Look at me! I'm great!"
        <br> <br>
        You step back in disgust of their sarcasm. "Look I was just trying to help."
        <br>  <br>   
        "Oh help! You want to help! Tell the dumb people who orchestrated this joke of a competition that they are evil! terrible! the worst! Tell them that they can barely pull it together to build anything of value. What a joke! Can't even complete the competition! What a joke! If I had been involved none of this would have happened. But no, no! They wouldn't let me judge!"
        <br> <br>
        You slink away as Woliod continues to yell and cry. You have other things to deal with.
