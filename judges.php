        You go to the judges' table.
        </h1>
        <p>
        You enter into the Judging room and there sits Thoid and Vemp at the table. They are both examining the table. You ask: "Find anything interesting?"
        <br>   <br>  
        "What? Oh no, nothing. Oh no nothing at all." Thois brushes some crumbs into their hands and brushes them onto the floor. 
        <br> <br>
        "Unfortunate how everything turned out here. How are you all holding up?"
        <br> <br>
        "Look we're fine. We don't need you in our business like this. We're pissed okay. This was Thoid's year and somebody had to go and ruin it! I'm mad okay! Mind your own business! Get out of here!" Vemp is angry and so you leave.
        <br> <br>
        As you walk away you notice Denot in the corner, crying.
        <br> <br>
        "Hey Denot how are you doing?"
        <br> <br>
        "I'm terrible! Someone stole my pie and now everything is ruined! I tried so hard this year! Why would anyone steal my pie? I was so close to winning! And now I have nothing! And I'm hungry! And there's no pie to eat! I won't even get a prize this year! I'm so angry! I'm so hurt!"
        <br> <br>
        You pat Denot on the head and leave the room.
