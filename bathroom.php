        You go to the bathroom.
        </h1>
        <p>
        You enter the bathroom. At first you notice Zid crying in the corner. Zid is crying and yelling: "I need a new oven now I'll never get one. Screw this crappy competition. I never had a chance!"
        <br>    
        "Hey Zid, why didn't you have a chance?"
        <br>
        "Don't you know anything!" Zid is angry and crying "that terrible judge hates apple pie! How was I supposed to know that! Screw her!"
        <br>
        Just as you are about to respond, Dolop walks in.
        <br>
        "Screw the judges!" yells Zid, running out of the room.
        <br>
        "Well excuse me! I don't even want to be here!" says Dolop.
        <br>    
        "Why not?"
        <br>
        "I signed up for a cake competition. And look where they put me. At a dumb pie competition. What a joke. Cake is far superior. I hate pie. If anything I'd like to thank the person that stole the pie. I'm glad it's over."
        <br>
        "I see."
        <br>
        As you leave the bathroom you notice Joid's feet in the last stall. Funny, you've heard multiple flushes from that stall...
