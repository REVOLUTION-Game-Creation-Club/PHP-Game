        You go to the bathroom.
        </h1>
        <p>
        You enter the bathroom. At first you notice Zid crying in the corner. Zid is crying and yelling: "I need a new oven now I'll never get one. Screw this crappy competition. I never had a chance!"
            
        "Hey Zid, why didn't you have a chance?"
        
        "Don't you know anything!" Zid is angry and crying "that terrible judge hates apple pie! How was I supposed to know that! Screw her!"
        
        Just as you are about to respond, Koupy walks in.
        
        "Screw the judges!" yells Zid, running out of the room.
        
        "Well excuse me! I don't even want to be here!" says Koupy.
            
        "Why not?"
        
        "I signed up for a cake competition. And look where they put me. At a dumb pie competition. What a joke. Cake is far superior. I hate pie. If anything I'd like to thank the person that stole the pie. I'm glad it's over."
        
        "I see."
        
        As you leave the bathroom you notice Joid's feet in the last stall. Funny, you've heard multiple flushes from that stall...
